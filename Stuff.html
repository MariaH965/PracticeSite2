                        Shold I do Law School? I wish they had a trial period...

                    <p> 
                        I want to do something interesting. I was interested in going into even more education after this but now I'm not entirely sure. I think this class has sparked an interest in web development for me. Maybe UX/UI, but I catch interests as fast as the flu, so that's not always reliable. I wanted to be a writer when I was younger, maybe I'll publish that epic fantasy one day, who knows? I did think about Law School, not sure about that either.I might apply to a program to test that one out. Otherwise i'll take things as they come right now.
